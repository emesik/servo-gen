servo-gen â€” Servo signal generator on Atmel ATtiny85.

This tool is a general servo tester and a simple example of AVR timer and
interrupt use (CTC mode).

The output signal has been implemented according to the description here:

However, for use with most modern RC servos, the pulse boundary has been
expanded to approximately 0.90-2.58ms range. Test it with your own servos.
